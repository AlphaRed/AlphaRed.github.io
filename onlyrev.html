<h2>Only Revolutions by MZD</h2>
<h1>A chapter-by-chapter synopsis</h1>
<p>Most will know that since this book is structured differently than most other novels, there are no defined chapters per se. Instead, I will use the reading "pattern" recommended by the publishers to define a chapter length. In this case, MZD and the publisher suggest to read one individual's story for eight pages and then flip to the other individual and read another eight. So one chapter will be eight pages from Hailey's story and then the same eight from Sam's side.</p>
<p><b>Forewarning!</b> This is my own interpretations and are not guaranteed to be correct or 100% complete as this is a work in progress. This project to document the book is for my own sanity. But with that being said, you may use this synopsis for your own reference.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1 (Pages 1 - 8)</h1>
<p><i>Hailey: </i><span class="spoiler">Hailey is a 16 yr old girl and is travelling and feeling on top of the world and in tune with the nature around her. That is until she meets a "moustached toother" who rapes her and sends her into a downward mental spiral where she comtemplates suicide. Just before going through with it she is interrupted by an "imbecile" who annoys her with their initial dialog before introducing himself as Sam.</span>
<br><i>Sam: </i><span class="spoiler">Sam is a 16 yr old boy and similarly to Hailey, is travelling and feeling in control of nature and things around him. He meets a woman who then steals his pony and he also comtemplates suicide because of this. Then a girl stumbles into him and he is amazed by her, who is introduced as Hailey.</span></p>
<h1>Chapter 2 (Pages 9 - 16)</h1>
<p><i>Hailey: </i><span class="spoiler">Hailey continues on her way and tries to lose Sam in the process. She later finds several groups of people who are amazed with her and her beauty to which she tries to escape from (similar reaction to Sam's amazement of her).
