<h2>Only Revolutions by MZD</h2>
<h1>A chapter-by-chapter synopsis</h1>
<p>Most will know that since this book is structured differently than most other novels, there are no defined chapters per se. Instead, I will use the reading "pattern" recommended by the publishers to define a chapter length. In this case, MZD and the publisher suggest to read one individual's story for eight pages and then flip to the other individual and read another eight. So one chapter will be eight pages from Hailey's story and then the same eight from Sam's side.</p>
<p><b>Forewarning!</b> This is my own interpretations and are not guaranteed to be correct or 100% complete as this is a work in progress. This project to document the book is for my own sanity. But with that being said, you may use this synopsis for your own reference.</p>
